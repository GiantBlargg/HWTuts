This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of the mechanics of Homeworld Remastered, but no prior knowledge of modding Homeworld Remastered.

Certain parts of this tutorial may be made easier by using the workshop tool, I would't know, it doesn't run on my system.

## Comparison of Campaign Loading methods (You can skip this part)

As of the June 9 update custom campaigns can be loaded in three different ways

* Overwriting the ascension campaign
* Specifing the campaign with the '-campaign' parameter
* Launching the campaign from the Extra Missions Menu

Here is a brief comparison of the pros and cons of these methods is below.

Method of Launching | Preserves the default save | Doesn't require launch parameters | Native Appearance
- | - | - | -
Overwriting the ascension campaign | <i class="fa fa-times fa-2x"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check fa-2x"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check fa-2x"></i>
Specifing the campaign with the '-campaign' parameter | <i class="fa fa-check fa-2x"></i> | <i class="fa fa-times fa-2x"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check fa-2x"></i>
Launching the campaign from the Extra Missions Menu | <i class="fa fa-check fa-2x"></i> | <i class="fa fa-check fa-2x"></i> | <i class="fa fa-times fa-2x"></i>

Launching from the Extra Missions Menu provides the least hassle for the end-user (the person playing your campaign) so that will be the method covered in this tutorial.
